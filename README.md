Sends texts when there is a new monitor on sale

This guy runs continuously on my Raspberry Pi while I am searching for a new monitor for my PC. It sends text messages to my personal phone number whenever a new monitor is posted for sale on r/buildapcsales. These texts contain the post body as well as the link for the monitor.
